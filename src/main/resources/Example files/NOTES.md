#Example files

A number of example files for various testing purposes has been supplied. If you wish to see how the program compresses and then decompresses one of these files, just copy-paste it to the root of the resources directory and then rename it to "Input.txt".

##Folder structure
###Canterbury Corpus Collection

- Mainly for benchmarking purposes.
- Original files can be found [here](https://corpus.canterbury.ac.nz/descriptions/#cantrbry)

###Real books

- These are actual books. They can give you a somewhat accurate idea of how a regular text's compression might behave.
  - The Republic by Plato can be found [here](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1497/pg1497.txt)
  - The Dhammapada can be found [here](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2017/pg2017.txt)
  - The King James version of The Bible can be found [here](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10900/pg10900.txt)

###Unicode texts

- These are meant to test how the program handles unicode characters.
  - Anglo-saxon poem was taken from [here](http://www.ragweedforge.com/rpaa.html). Originally seen in [this site](http://kermitproject.org/utf8.html)
  - The remaining two files were taken from [here](https://www.w3.org/2001/06/utf-8-test/UTF-8-demo.html).
